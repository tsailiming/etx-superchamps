## What Is 1-2-4-All?

1-2-4-All is a way for every member of a large group to participate and generate ideas together. It is highly scalable and can be used for almost any group size.

## Why Do 1-2-4-All?

- All voices are heard, incorporating “silent” conversations and expanding input diversity - No more HiPPOs (Highest Paid Person’s Opinion)!
- Broad engagement naturally improves consensus and shared understanding
- Iterative feedback improves outcomes

## How to do 1-2-4-All?

1. The facilitator asks a question about an issue, problem to resolve, or a proposal to put forward (_e.g., What opportunities do YOU see for making progress on this challenge? How would you handle this situation? What ideas or actions do you recommend?_)
2. Individuals self-reflect on the shared challenge \[1 min.\]
3. Individuals pair up to generate ideas in pairs, building on ideas from self-reflection. \[2 min.\]
4. Pairs group into foursomes to share and develop ideas from each pair. \[4 min.\]
5. Repeat cycle as needed.
6. The facilitator pulls the entire group together to share and develop a common idea. \[5 min.\]
