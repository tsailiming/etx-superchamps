# Backlog Refinement

## Excerpt

What is It? Having a conversation to provide clarity surrounding the detail or conditions of satisfaction for work items in the backlog‚Ä¶

- Drive team shared understanding of work items in regards to:

  - Scope of work in the backlog
  - Conditions of satisfaction
  - Prioritization of what to do first

### How often should it occur and for how long?

- The simple answer is as often as is necessary.
- Typically it's advised that 1 hour of refinement a week is enough.

### Tips for Remote Working

- This is perhaps the one of the most difficult to do remotely to keep the team engaged, especially if there hasn‚Äôt been a proper preparation by the Product Owner and Engagement Lead.
- Ensure the Product Owner is prepared and has the necessary details and research done prior to the group getting together.
- You can rotate role for leading the sessions to increase the team engagement with less passive behaviours and reduce tiredness on a single person acting as lead.
- Organise multiple small sessions instead of a single long one for remote refinement, otherwise the session becomes tedious and people lose focus.
- Use the virtual tools available to make as interactive as possible.
- Use online tools to share the product backlog.
- Share definition of done and ready with the team and keep them on display during the meeting.

### Advice

- Although typically occurring as a team meeting, backlog refinement can occur throughout the week with the required parties. However information gained in this meeting must be adequately radiated to those who need it.lk
- Product owners are also not necessarily required for a backlog refinement. The key is to have those who have sufficient knowledge to talk through a backlog item and answer questions. This may come in the form of a Product owner, Stakeholder, Developer etc
