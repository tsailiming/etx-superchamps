HMW, short for ‚ÄúHow Might We ‚Ä¶?‚Äù, is an analytical technique relying on actionable questions asked from a particular point of view on a specific problem. They can be used to spur creative problem solving and produce insights, which lead to significant innovation. It can be used for Brainstorming, but is not necessarily a brainstorming approach. HMW is frequently used as part of Design Thinking sessions.

You need a challenge, a Point of View and a set of relevant questions starting with ‚ÄúHow Might We ‚Ä¶?‚Äù

 Multiple HMW questions could be asked in order to dive deeper in the challenge and unveil different perspectives. The following are different perspectives, which can be used to look at the challenge through HMW questions:

- Question an assumption
- Go after adjectives
- Identify unexpected resources
- Create an analogy from need or context
- Play against the challenge
- Change a status quo
- Break PoV into pieces
