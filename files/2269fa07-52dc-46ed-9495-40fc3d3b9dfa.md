This Design Thinking practice is exactly what the title says - the team members have to imagine the box/packaging for a new product. They need to come up with slogans that correspond to the essence of the product/service, highlight the most important valuable features it aims at. It gets the team to think from a big picture perspective and from the shoes of the potential customers and to start designing a new product/service. In different formats you may either start with a blank box or provide carton to participants and ask them to design the box in the process.

### Why & How to combine it with other practices?

-   This practice is really helpful if you find it hard to articulate the goal during an [Impact Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/impact-mapping/) session. It can help articulate product vision and ambitions
-   It is also a good transition from a vision into a more concrete description of expected product/service design, e.g. through [Event Storming](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/event-storming/)
-   It can provide interesting input for Value Proposition and Lean Canvas
